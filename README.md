# MakeUofT2021Proj
Make UofT Hackathon 2021 - Group: Alexander Tran, David Henein, Myles Esteban, Shane Hsieh

# How to clone the repo:
1. make a folder for the project and navigate to it with the command line/terminal
2. hit code and copy the HTTPS link
3. git clone (link_here)

# Opening files in unity
The actual unity project file is "Platformer_Proj_MakeUofT2021", so you will need to open unity and add that folder as the project
- Do note that there is a weird thing where the scene doesn't show up if you pull/clone for the first time, to fix go to File > Open Scene, then open the correct scene

# Making changes 
- should probably make a branch and pull request, but if working in main branch just:
1. git add . (or the file name)
2. git commit -m "changes description message here"
3. git push

Then just git pull to pull the latest changes
